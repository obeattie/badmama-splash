            <h3>Because you had a baby, not a lobotomy.</h3>
            <p>Mother and baby groups not for you? More interested in a martini than another round of The Wheels on the Bus? Here at Bad Mama we believe that you don't stop needing glamour and excitement just because you've become a mum. And regularly. There are a thousand and one opinions on How To Be A Good Mum – it's a thorny old business these days and we'd like to balance it out by helping you to remain the fabulous creature you are. Post partum doesn't have to mean post fun.</p>
            <p>If you're a Bad Mama and you want to meet other likeminded women, enjoy fabulous events, network, set up businesses, get a make over, even go on fabulous holidays – with and without your little ones and other halves then this club is for you. The rules – no baggy old clothes, best underwear at all times (even if no one sees it), plenty of attitude, plenty of laughter and a new kind of motherhood for the 21st century&hellip;</p>
